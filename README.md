# Finding_topological_defects_in_polar_field
Topological defects are the singularities in the order parameter field. They are characterized by winding numbers.
The mathematical description is given by, $n = \frac{\oint \vec{\nabla} \theta \cdot d\vec{r}}{2\pi}$. Where, n is the winding number and $\theta$ is given by, $\theta = tan^{-1}\frac{n_y}{n_x}$.$n_{y}$ and $n_{x}$ being the y and x component of the vector, $\vec{n}$. 
This repository contains code for finding topological defects from the orientational field. In the repository, the nx_data.txt and ny_data.txt represent the x and y components of the 2D vector field.
