# Finding_topological_defects_in_polar_field
Topological defects are the singularities in the order parameter field. They are characterized by winding numbers.
The mathematical description is given by, $n = \frac{1}{2\pi}\oint \vec{\nabla} \theta \cdot d\vec{r}$. Where, n is the winding number and $\theta$ is given by, $\theta = tan^{-1}\left(\frac{n_y}{n_x}\right) + \phi$.$n_{y}$ and $n_{x}$ being the y and x component of the vector, $\vec{n}$ and $\phi$ is the phase of the defect orientation which helps to detect inward, outward, spiral defect and saddle point. 
This repository contains code for finding topological defects from the orientational field. In the repository, the nx_data.txt and ny_data.txt represent the x and y components of the 2D vector field.
