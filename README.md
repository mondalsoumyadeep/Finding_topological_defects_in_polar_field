# Finding_topological_defects_in_polar_field
Topological defects are the singularities in the order parameter field. They are characterized by winding number.
The mathematical description is given by, $s = \frac{\oint \nable \theta d\vec{r}}{2\pi}$
This repository contains code for finding topological defects from the orientational field. In the repository, the nx_data.txt and ny_data.txt represent the x and y components of the 2D vector field.
